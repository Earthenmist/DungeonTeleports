MythicDungeonTeleports  
  
A World of Warcraft addon for quick and easy dungeon and raid teleports.  
  
📌 What is DungeonTeleports?

✅ Optional auto-insert Mythic Keystone (disabled by default)

⚔️ Combat Safety (Midnight Compatible)  
  
DungeonTeleports is designed to respect modern combat restrictions:  
Cooldown data is suppressed during combat to avoid protected “secret value” errors  
UI show/hide actions are safely deferred until combat ends  
Tooltips display a friendly notice when cooldown info is unavailable  
Minimap interactions are blocked during combat to prevent taint  
All functionality resumes automatically after combat.  
  
⚙️ Settings  
  
Accessible via /dtpconfig or the Blizzard Settings menu.  
  
Available options include:  
Show / hide minimap button  
Default expansion selection  
Auto-insert Mythic Keystone (optional, off by default)  
UI behaviour and display preferences  
Settings open correctly on Retail (11.x) and Midnight (12.x) clients.
